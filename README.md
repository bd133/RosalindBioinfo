# RosalindBioinfo

Welcome to my RosalindBioinfo Repository. This folder contains mostly the Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold problems, with some problems from other categories as well. Most of them are finished in the fall 2018 semester. If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, please email me: xw46@iu.edu. Have a good one!
